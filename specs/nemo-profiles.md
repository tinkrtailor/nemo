# Nemo Profiles

## Overview

Support multiple nautiloop clusters per engineer via named profiles in `~/.nemo/config.toml`. Switch active cluster with `nemo use-profile <name>`, override per-command with `--profile <name>`. Same conceptual model as `kubectl` contexts, `aws` profiles, `gcloud configurations`.

Before: one `server_url` + one `api_key` in the CLI config; switching clusters means hand-editing the file or setting env vars for every command.

After: `nemo use-profile work` flips the active cluster in one command. Every other nemo invocation uses it.

## Baseline

Main at PR #185 (v0.7.3) merge.

Current `~/.nemo/config.toml` shape (`cli/src/config.rs`):
```toml
server_url = "http://localhost:18080"
engineer = "dev"
name = "Dev User"
email = "dev@example.com"
api_key = "dev-api-key-..."

[models]        # optional engineer-level model overrides
# implementor = "..."
# reviewer = "..."

[helm]
desktop_notifications = false
```

Commands read this file once at startup via `config::load_config()`. `nemo config --set key=value` writes scalar fields in-place. `--server` flag on each command overrides `server_url`.

## Problem Statement

### Problem 1: One engineer, multiple clusters is common

Operators realistically have:
- A local dev cluster (`http://localhost:18080`)
- A personal self-hosted production cluster (`http://<tailscale-ip>:8080`)
- A team production cluster at the company's nautiloop deployment

Today they manage this via:
- Hand-editing `~/.nemo/config.toml` when they switch
- OR typing `--server http://... --api-key ...` on every command (api-key flag doesn't exist currently; users set `NAUTILOOP_API_KEY` env var instead)

Both are bad UX. Kubectl solved this in 2015 with contexts; nemo should inherit the pattern.

### Problem 2: No "which cluster am I on" answer

Engineers lose track. The closest today is `nemo config` which prints the single set of fields. A profile-aware CLI prints the active profile name prominently and makes mistakes obvious.

### Problem 3: Scripts have to reset state

Automation that touches multiple clusters has to save + restore `~/.nemo/config.toml`. Profiles let a script run `NEMO_PROFILE=staging nemo status` cleanly.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Config schema

**FR-1a.** New `~/.nemo/config.toml` shape:

```toml
current_profile = "personal"   # which profile is active

[profiles.personal]
server_url = "http://100.64.1.10:8080"
api_key = "abc123..."
engineer = "gunnar"
name = "Gunnar"
email = "gunnar@reitun.is"

[profiles.work]
server_url = "https://nautiloop.work.internal"
api_key = "xyz789..."
engineer = "ggylfason"
name = "Gunnar"
email = "gunnar@work.example.com"

[profiles.dev]
server_url = "http://localhost:18080"
api_key = "dev-api-key-..."
engineer = "dev"

# Non-profile sections persist at the top level:
[helm]
desktop_notifications = false

[models]
# empty; kept at root as engineer-global preference
```

**FR-1b.** Profile names MUST match `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*$` (letters, digits, hyphens; start alphanumeric). Reserved name `default` is allowed.

**FR-1c.** `current_profile` MUST point at a defined profile. If missing or invalid, CLI errors on any command that needs a server URL.

### FR-2: Backward-compatible migration

**FR-2a.** If the current `~/.nemo/config.toml` has flat `server_url`/`api_key`/etc. at the root (pre-profile shape), first-run of ANY nemo command that would touch config:
1. Reads the flat values
2. Creates a profile `default` under `[profiles.default]` containing them
3. Sets `current_profile = "default"`
4. Strips the flat fields from the root
5. Writes the file back
6. Prints: `Migrated config to profile 'default'. Create additional profiles with 'nemo profile add <name>'.`

Migration is idempotent: no-op if already in profile shape.

**FR-2b.** Environment variables that existed pre-migration (`NAUTILOOP_API_KEY`) continue to work and override the active profile's value. No behavior change for scripts.

### FR-3: `nemo profile` subcommands

**FR-3a.** New top-level command group:

| Command | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `nemo profile ls` (alias `list`) | Print all profiles, one per line, active one marked `*`. Include server_url and engineer for context. |
| `nemo profile show [<name>]` | Print the full profile detail. Omit name = current profile. Redacts api_key (`***` or first/last 4 chars). |
| `nemo profile add <name>` | Interactive: prompt for server_url, api_key, engineer (with defaults from current if applicable). Writes new profile. Does NOT switch to it; use `use-profile` separately. `--switch` flag combines both. |
| `nemo profile rm <name>` | Remove profile. Errors if `<name>` is the active one. |
| `nemo profile rename <old> <new>` | Rename. If `<old>` was active, update `current_profile` accordingly. |
| `nemo use-profile <name>` (alias `nemo profile use`) | Set `current_profile = <name>` in config. Prints new active state. Errors if `<name>` doesn't exist. |

**FR-3b.** `nemo profile add` with `--server`, `--api-key`, `--engineer` flags creates non-interactively. Missing values prompt.

**FR-3c.** Tab completion for profile names on the `profile` / `use-profile` subcommands via clap's completion generation.

### FR-4: `--profile` global flag + env var

**FR-4a.** Every command accepts `--profile <name>` (global flag, same level as `--server`). Override applies only to that invocation; doesn't modify `current_profile`.

**FR-4b.** Environment variable `NAUTILOOP_PROFILE=<name>` has the same effect. Precedence: `--profile` > `NAUTILOOP_PROFILE` > `current_profile`.

**FR-4c.** If a specified profile doesn't exist (via flag or env), CLI errors with the full list: `Profile 'staging' not found. Available: dev, personal, work.`

### FR-5: `nemo status` / `nemo helm` profile indicator

**FR-5a.** `nemo status` output gains a header line naming the active profile:

```
# Profile: work · https://nautiloop.work.internal
LOOP ID ...
```

**FR-5b.** `nemo helm` TUI header (existing "NAUTILOOP" top-left) appends the profile in muted color: `NAUTILOOP · work`. Tells the operator at a glance which cluster they're driving.

**FR-5c.** `nemo config` (with no args) now prints the active profile + all profile names, not just flat fields.

### FR-6: `nemo config --set` aware of profiles

**FR-6a.** `nemo config --set server_url=<...>` writes to the ACTIVE profile's `server_url`. No migration needed — it already wrote a scalar; now it writes into the active profile block.

**FR-6b.** `nemo config --set --profile=<name> server_url=<...>` writes to the named profile (useful for scripting).

**FR-6c.** `nemo config --set helm.desktop_notifications=true` continues writing to the root (non-profile) section. Profile-specific vs root-global disambiguation is by the dotted path; root-level sections (`[helm]`, `[models]`) remain at root.

### FR-7: Non-profile config persists across migration

**FR-7a.** After migration, `[helm]`, `[models]` at the root persist unchanged. They're engineer-global preferences, not cluster-scoped.

**FR-7b.** Per-profile `[models]` / `[helm]` overrides are OUT OF SCOPE for v1. Don't introduce per-profile sub-tables unless requested. Simple model: profiles contain connection info only.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Zero breakage for existing users

Any existing `~/.nemo/config.toml` works via FR-2 migration. First command after upgrading to this version silently migrates and continues. If a user downgrades later, the profile shape is unreadable to old CLI — documented but accepted. (Binary has `version` field optional; not requiring it for v1.)

### NFR-2: No new dependencies

`toml` crate already used. No new crates.

### NFR-3: Secret handling

API keys in the file stay at 0600 permissions (matches current behavior). `nemo profile show` redacts by default. No logging of keys.

### NFR-4: Tests

- **Unit** (`cli/src/config.rs`): migration from flat → profiles is idempotent; adds a profile; removes a profile; renames; switches active.
- **Unit**: precedence chain `--profile` > `NAUTILOOP_PROFILE` > `current_profile`.
- **Integration** (`cli/tests/profiles.rs`): spawn nemo with a test HOME, run migration, run `profile ls`, `use-profile`, `profile rm`.

## Acceptance Criteria

A reviewer can verify by:

1. **Migration**: start with a pre-profile `~/.nemo/config.toml` (flat fields). Run `nemo status`. File is rewritten with `[profiles.default]` and `current_profile = "default"`. Status still works.
2. **Add + switch**: `nemo profile add work --server https://... --api-key xyz --engineer gunnar`. Then `nemo use-profile work`. `nemo status` uses the new server.
3. **Per-command override**: `nemo --profile dev status` uses dev's server; `nemo status` right after still uses work (current_profile unchanged).
4. **Env var**: `NAUTILOOP_PROFILE=dev nemo status` uses dev without flag.
5. **List + show**: `nemo profile ls` marks active with `*`. `nemo profile show work` prints the work profile with `api_key` redacted.
6. **Cannot remove active**: `nemo profile rm <active>` errors clearly; no accidental lockout.
7. **Helm indicator**: `nemo helm` top-left shows `NAUTILOOP · work` when work is active.

## Out of Scope

- **Per-profile model overrides** (engineer wants different defaults per cluster). Profiles are connection-only in v1.
- **Profile import/export** (sharing profiles between engineers). Everyone configures their own; API keys are per-engineer anyway.
- **Sync profiles from a central source** (company rolls out profiles via a script). Operators write their own bootstrap if they want this.
- **Encrypt profile file**. 0600 permissions + keychain integration is a bigger spec; current plaintext matches today's behavior.
- **Auto-detect cluster from URL probe**. Explicit config only.

## Files Likely Touched

- `cli/src/config.rs` — new profile-aware schema; migration function; accessor helpers.
- `cli/src/commands/profile.rs` — new module with `ls`, `show`, `add`, `rm`, `rename`, `use_profile`.
- `cli/src/commands/config.rs` — route `--set` through the active profile resolver.
- `cli/src/main.rs` — `--profile` global flag; profile command group; `NAUTILOOP_PROFILE` env.
- `cli/src/commands/status.rs` — header line with active profile.
- `cli/src/commands/helm.rs` — TUI title append.
- Tests per NFR-4.
- `docs/local-dev-quickstart.md` — brief mention of profiles.
